For spam test, use the vocabulary list from [Data2Science/vocab.txt at master Â· jetorz/Data2Science (github.com)](https://github.com/jetorz/Data2Science/blob/master/2020-04-26-ML-SVM/vocab.txt), and append new features by running `featurize.py`

> Note: It is said we can achieve better performance by deleting some features that are less predictive. Try it out! :)

For cifar test,  I use hog features, LBP features and color features. Feel free to add more helpful stuffs!
